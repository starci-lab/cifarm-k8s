# CiFarm Kubernetes Configuration

This repository contains a Helm chart that deploys CiFarm along with Bitnami and Kuda Helm chart dependencies, such as databases, caching systems, and message brokers.

This README explains how to deploy your CiFarm application alongside dependencies (e.g., MySQL from Bitnami, Redis from Kuda) using Helm on a Kubernetes cluster.
